This has A synopsis of my work and conclusions.
Data Acquisition I Used a great data set found on Kaggle providing over 50 years of season by season stats data which you can find here https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats#Seasons_Stats.csv. I also pulled data NBA Stats.com by Parsing a Json File found at. http://data.nba.net/10s/prod/v1/2016/players.json.
Data Persistence I then Persisted the data into a PostgreSQL Database.
Data Analysis In my project I tried to deep dive into a couple key factors. Hoping to see what defines all-star players seasons, and what A championship team consists of.
Conclusions the NBA has shifted away from relying on just 1 player taking most of the shots. The NBA starting lineups of winning teams now consist of 2 to 3 players that most of the field goal attempts go through, and 2 to 3 efficient players not taking a high amount of shot volume. The NBA seems shot volume has gone down Per Player/ Focusing more on efficiency
