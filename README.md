Thyis has A synopsis of my work and conclusions. 

#Data Acquisition 
I Used a great data set found on kaggle proiding over 50 years of season by season stats data which you can find here https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats#Seasons_Stats.csv. I also pulled data NBA Stats.com by Parsing a Json File found at.
http://data.nba.net/10s/prod/v1/2016/players.json. 

#Data Persistence
I then Persisted the data into a Postgresql Database. 

#Data Analysis
In my project I tried to deep dive into a couple key factors. Hoping to see what defines all star players seasons, and what A champoinship team consists of. 

#Conclusions
The nba has shifted away from relying on just 1 player taking a majority of the shots. The nba starting lineups of winning teams now consist of 2 to 3 players that most of the field goal attempts go through, and  2 to 3 efficient players not taking a high amount of shot volume. Also shot volume as a whole has gone down Per Player/ Focousing more on efficiency.
